Being that KingsIsle aren't the most security-conscious developers, they left all of their message information in clear text for us to use!

To get the current messages, you can extract them from your root.wad file (located in Wizard101\Data\GameData\)

To do so, you will need the free tool [Quickbms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)  
You will also need the [kiwad extractor](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/wizard101_kiwad.bms) located on that same website.

Once you've downloaded them both, extract all of the files in the quickbms zip file.
Place the 'wizard101_kiwad.bms' file in the same folder you extracted quickbms.

Drag 'wizard101_kiwad.bms' onto 'quickbms.exe'
In the window that opens, select your Root.wad file.
Choose a folder to extract the contents.

When quickbms has finished extracting all of the files in root.wad, open the directory you extracted the files.
There will be a lot of .xml files in the root directory.
Any files that end with 'Messages.xml' will be message files.
You will also find some messages inside the 'Messages' sub-folder.

Each message file will have a 'ServiceID' entry near the top. This is the Service ID that is used to determine which message-file to use.
eg; if a packet had a Service ID of 5, it would use the GameMessages.xml file, because GameMessages has a Service ID of 5.

MessageID is a bit trickier though.
Unless the message file contains 'MsgOrder' entries (not many files do), the MessageID will be determined by sorting the message names alphabetically.

To save time, I've created a tool that will take any message files and output the message-names in order (eg; line 1 is msgid 1, line 50 is msgid 50)
Parsing messages by looking up the msgid and grabbing the data types automatically could be used to parse unhandled client>server messages. But we'll still need to add handlers (and responses) for each svcid/msgid anyway, so it's kind of pointless.
